# plantGuard

In development. A free and open-source plant monitor.

Uses the OSEPP-HUMI-01 and OSEPP-LIGHT-01 sensors. Requires the DHT library available at https://github.com/markruys/arduino-DHT to interface with the OSEPP-HUMI-01 humidity and temperature sensor.

I'm running with an Arduino Micro but this should work on an Uno, Mega, or other not-extremely-weird *duino-ish board.
